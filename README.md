I'm David, and I LOVE everything related to technology, and especially how it works. I find old tech fascinating and programming is likely my favorite hobby.

### Some other stuff about me
* I love reading and writing clean code!
* I LOVE skeumorphism GUIs and I will ALWAYS prefer it over any minimalist design.
* Yes, I am weird.
